## 3D game

<p>I also called this game as Strawberry Splash. I used <b>Unity Engine</b> and <b>Visual Studio 2015</b> to develop two 3D games with sound effect.</p>
<p>Wrote code in <b>C#</b> to determine the mechanic of games.</p>
<p>Used physics engine, collision detection and camera behavior for object movements.</p>
<p>Used <b>Photoshop</b> to create game objects.</p>
<p>Designed and modeled environments, props, and characters using Blender.</p>
